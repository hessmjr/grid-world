# Grid World MDP
Markov Decision Process experiment and analysis using Burlap's grid world

## Usage
Steps necessary to re-run this application:

  1. Update the Configuration class.  All pertinent settings are stored in this class such as which
  domain to build and which type of agent or planner to utilize in creating the best value function.
  
  2. Compile the JAR using the Gradle wrapper and then execute the application.  The following 
  commands will handle this, from the project root directory:
  
  ```
  ./gradlew clean build
  java -jar build/libs/mdp.jar
  ```
